# bluetooth
Hi All, i would like to share the confgiuration (embedded linux board based) in IMX6, to use its SSI interace for connecting of bluetooth module SSI interface (PCM IN, PCM OUT, PCM CLK, PCM SYNC). I have added a codec driver bt-sco. and dummy sound card imx-btsco.c. The file devicetree contain the necessary lines of code that needed to be added on your master device tree..
